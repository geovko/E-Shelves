## Description

Despite e-commerce playing a crucial role in making the shopping process easier and more efficient for the user, managing inventory and organizing products still continue to be aspects of commerce that companies still have to consider. This project aims to facilitate the process of managing inventory and organizing products by providing an online database of products that the user can interact with. The development of this project was a bit more straightforward due to the guidance of the starter code creators, but eventually making all the parts function together did take time and seemingly endless debugging.

## Usage

Access the Walk-Through video through the link provided below!

```

When first beginning to use the code, make sure to enter in 'npm install' to install all the necessary packages, 'npm run seed' to create the database (and fill it with example category, product, and tag data), and 'npm start' to run the server. As can be see from the Walkthrough Video, Insomnia has been used to display the functionality of the GET (all items), GET (a single item), POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

## Credits

This project wouldn't have been completed without the aid of demonstrations and assignments provided by the UCI Bootcamp teaching staff. Moreover, this project wouldn't have been possible without the starter code provided by staff under the project title 'bookish-sniffle'.
